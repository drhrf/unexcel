Title: Revert Excel Serial Dates Back to Intended Day.Month Numerics

Description: Detects values imported from spreadsheets that were auto-converted 
    to Excel date serials and reconstructs the originally intended day.month
    decimals (for example, '30.3' that Excel displayed as '30/03/2025').
    The functions work in a vectorized manner, preserve non-serial values, and 
    support both the 1900 and 1904 date systems.
