# unexcel

Detect and revert spreadsheet auto-converted Excel date serials back to the intended `day.month` numerics.  

This package provides functions to identify values imported as Excel date serials (for example, `45812` representing 2025-03-30) and reconstruct the original numeric entry such as `30.3`. Non-serial values are preserved, and both the 1900 and 1904 date systems are supported.

## Installation

You can install the development version from GitHub with:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("drhrf/unexcel")
```

## Example

```r
library(unexcel)

# 45812 is 2025-03-30 in Excel's 1900 system
x <- c(45812, 12.5, 44730)

restore_day_month(x, origin_mode = "1900")
#> [1] 30.3 12.5 15.6
```
